			When I was in my elementary years, I had studied at <strong> Punta Princesa Elementary School </strong>, all I ever thought was to have fun, play outdoor activities with friends and play toys. Back then, life was so simple and easy, it was very fun, happy and stress-free. I was so naive and innocent, ignorant of the real world. During my late years at elementary school, I was blessed with twin sisters, Cherzyle and Chrizyle, and I was so happy and excited that I would not show up at school just so I could take care of them and play with them. I didn't really like school back then but even though it was the case, I still got good grades and would still belong in the top achievers in class <small> ( AN: perhaps I was simply too smart ^áµ•^ ) </small> .I was also sometimes bullied because of my height and I easily get scared or intimidated by teachers and other students that's why I didn't like school so much.
