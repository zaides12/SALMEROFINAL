				I studied at <strong> University of Cebu - Main Campus </strong> during my Senior High School years. I studied there for 2 years and I took up STEM. I had spent most of my senior high school facing the screen of my computer and my cellphone. I could say it was the worst ever because I had to stay home because of COVID. I was at the end of my 10th grade when COVID spread like wildfire in the Philippines so I had to stay home and away from people aside from my family. So basically all of my memories at this stage of my life were mostly about online class which was very difficult and stressful at first. I was on the same page with the other students that said they didn't learn much in online class. Even though, it was very difficult during the start, I started to get used to it at a later time but still the gap in efficiency between face to face classes and online classes was really big. Honestly, I prefer online class in terms of convinience, it was easy going in and out of class and <del> I can make use of lag, internet and electricity problems	as an excuse for not being in class. </del> I liked some of my classmates and teachers as well and bonded with them in class. I was less  participative in class during those times and was mainly focused in playing <i> online games, watching anime and reading light novels.</i> Even so, I still scored good marks and got good grades, <em> I graduated Senior High School in UC with </em> <strong> High Honors</strong>. Additionally, I also got a <strong> girlfriend </strong> during my 12th year. She's the prettiest and she's all I could ever ask for that's why I'm beyond grateful for her. If ever you're curious about her, her name is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hannaniyamari" target="_blank">Hannaniah Marie Vergara</a> and I love her a lot.
